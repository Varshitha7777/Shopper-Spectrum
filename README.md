## ðŸ”§ Project Pipeline

### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
- Explore data structure
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and invalid entries

### Step 2: Preprocessing
- Remove rows with missing `CustomerID`
- Remove canceled invoices (`InvoiceNo` starts with 'C')
- Exclude negative or zero quantities/prices

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Country-wise transaction volume
- Top-selling products
- Time-based purchase trends
- RFM distributions
- Elbow curve for optimal clusters

### Step 4: RFM Feature Engineering & Clustering
- Recency = Days since last purchase
- Frequency = Number of purchases
- Monetary = Total amount spent
- Standardize features
- Apply K-Means clustering
- Label segments:
  - High-Value
  - Regular
  - Occasional
  - At-Risk
- Visualize customer clusters

### Step 5: Product Recommendation
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Compute cosine similarity matrix (CustomerID Ã— StockCode)
- Recommend top 5 similar products to a given product
